<em>Old version of the website</em></p>

<p>Insomnia is hitting me hard - and after hours of trying to (and failing at) falling asleep, I decided that I might as well make my time worthwhile while I‚Äôm at it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had some ideas at the top of my head for what I wanted in my website. In particular, I wanted my website to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tell my <em>story</em> better - in a format that reads more like a narrative,</li>
  <li>be more maintainable,</li>
  <li>have reusable common elements - through Components,</li>
  <li>as a side benefit, implement the Single Page Application model,</li>
  <li>let me try my hand at web design and development again,</li>
  <li>at the very least, have no dead links (right now, the <em>About me</em> and <em>My projects</em> links are pretty much dead) üòÖ, and</li>
  <li>implement the design ideas I sketched and had floating around my head for weeks but never got around to finally implementing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I used Angular before for several projects: <a href="http://hookturns.info"><em>HookTurns</em></a> and  <a href="https://openelement.herokuapp.com"><em>OpenElement</em></a>, and although the learning curve for Angular was quite steep, I found Angular‚Äôs rich feature-set especially rewarding for me.</p>

<p>Alas that‚Äôs enough of an introduction - I should get started with the project.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli"><code class="highlighter-rouge">@angular/cli</code></a> - this utility lets you easily create a project, run it locally, build the project, run tests and even reduces the amount of boilerplate code you have to write for Components, Directives, Services. Just use this - it makes your life easier, and makes me wish I started with this when I first worked with Angular<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> several times before (including my old site), and I‚Äôm coming back to it for this version of the website too. If you‚Äôre not familiar with it (unlikely), Bootstrap is a front-end framework for responsive design websites, providing a grid system, UI elements and components, and styling (which can still be customised via CSS).</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>Instead of simply building off a Bootstrap template, I wanted to use Bootstrap elements (and design ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù) with some code to help with the UI behaviours I want:</p>

<em>A top bar that collapses when users scroll down on the page.</em></p>

<img src="https://krusli.github.io/assets/nav-indicator1.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="https://krusli.github.io/assets/nav-indicator2.jpg" alt="" />
<em>A navigation indicator (on the right-hand side of the pages here) to indicate the user‚Äôs current location and lets the user jump between sections. I plan to have my navigation indicator on the left hand side of the page though.</em></p>

      <p>Google‚Äôs <a href="https://angular.io/guide/quickstart">Angular guides</a> had me configuring the dev environment myself - downloading the libraries, configuring scripts for the webserver and transpiler, taking too much effort and even refusing to do a Webpack build for me in the end. The guide has since been updated to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">@angular/cli</code>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
